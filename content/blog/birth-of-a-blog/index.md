title: How This Blog Was Born

TLDR: I taught myself how to build this site with a combination of the official Gatsby Documentation and tutorials. I came to realize that the Gatsby Documentation itself is all you need. (Always read the docs! Always!) I am also looking for dedicated individuals to collaborate on a project with me. See the end of this post for details.

It took me a while to figure out how I wanted to write this. I thought I'd make my own little tutorial and guide someone through the process, but I think for my "tutorial" posts I'll stick to the smaller concepts. Instead, I'll take you through my journey and thought process as I built this site from the bottom up.

So at first, it was the idea. I'd been scouring Twitter, following different developers and learning about their journeys. I found one thing in common with all of the developers that I admired: they all gave back to the community and provided resources for everyone to use. Now, as someone new to this field, I wondered, what contributions can I make? I’m still learning this stuff myself. Even then, I found myself wanting to put myself out there, just dive in and see what I could give back. So I decided to head over to Wordpress and get ready to build a blog. I'd done this before with my music so I wasn't a stranger to using the free Wordpress tools to get started. But then, I stopped myself just as I opened up the Wordpress home page, and thought, “maybe it would be more fun if I built this on my own.”

I started reading up on different ways of building a blog. During my research I came across Gatsby. Gatsby is a static site generator powered by React and GraphQL. I instantly fell in love with its features after briefly watching a few tutorial videos, I was hooked but I had another problem: I've only ever built one react component ever, oh and there was the fact that I had no idea what GraphQL was. Well that’s even more exciting!. I gave myself a crash course on React and dove right into some tutorials on Gatsby. I found Level Up Tutorials super helpful for getting me started but noticed something about why it was so helpful, Scott Tolinski referred back to the amazing documentation left by the Gatsby team. That’s when I dove into Gatsby and even with a very basic understanding of React I was able to follow along and understand what I needed to do in order to bring this blog up and running.

The main lesson I took away from this, sometimes it’s better to stop obsessing over an online tutorial to help you learn something and just read the docs. I'll admit not everyone’s documentation is as accessible as Gatsby's but this is where you'll really gain an understand of any new technology. All those cool answers that we love to copy and paste from Stack Overflow? They usually come from someone who has read the docs and has a deeper understanding of why the solution they're giving you works. They'll at times be not so nice or forgiving to us newbies but those of them who gruffly tell you to "read the docs!" do have a point if you get past the terrible delivery. Once I dove into it I actually started to get why some of the stuff I was doing works instead of just rehashing what I saw on a bunch of different tutorials. I'm not knocking the tutorials of course, when you're learning something completely new those are amazing for getting a good foundational knowledge.

For a list of the resources that really helped me here in launching this I'll just refer to the following two:

<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evAUPPs7fB0" target="_blank">Level up Tutorials introduction to Gatsby</a>

<a href = "https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/" target="_blank">The official Gatsby Documentation</a>

I am in no way affiliated with either of them, just love both of their work!

So now I've already started thinking about the next steps. Initially I thought of recruiting other people who are also beginners for guest blog posts, I may still do that but it wasn’t enough to satisfy me. What do I really want to do to shake things up and really develop my skills further? I drew inspiration from Emma Wedekind's project <a href = "https://codingcoach.io/" target="_blank">Coding Coach</a>. Absolutely check it out, it's a resource I plan to take advantage of when it launches! I've decided to start my own open source project that I hope to be built in collaboration with others who are breaking into a career as a web developer.

I'd like to form a community of those of us who are learning about web development and create a platform for finding others like us trying to hone their skills and ready themselves for their leap into a new career. My vision is that we create a collaborative platform where anyone can post a fun project idea and recruit others to help create it. Kind of like what I’m doing now. If you are interested in getting together and mapping something out send me a message on Twitter or LinkedIn. You can find links to both at the bottom of every page on this blog! I'll start a slack channel once there a few people interested and we can really start planning something out!

April 2015 2019 Edit: I've refactored this blog using a starter I liked better from the Gatsby Starters page. Check those out to get jumpstarted on your next blog!

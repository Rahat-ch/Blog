title: 'How JavaScript Works Part 1 - Memory and Call stack'
---

This is part 1 of a series of posts all about how JavaScript works. The information here is presented as my summary of knowledge gained from the following sources:

- Will Sentance's JavaScript: The Hard Parts course on Front End Masters.

- Andrei Neagoie's The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery. 

I gain nothing by promoting them, these are simply two of the sources I have used to learn about JavaScript and feel are probably the ones feuling the information in this blog post. 

With that out of the way, lets talk about how JavaScript works! 

This post is going to focus on two things to start off, Memory and the Call stack. 

Whenever we start programming in JavaScript we have to store some data in our code that is used when an engine executes it. An example of an engine that can execute JavaScript is Chrome's V8 engine. This is what translates all of your JavaScript into something the browser can understand. 

The first thing the engine looks at is the memory of your code. These are all of the variables you have declared. For example:

```javascript

const a = "Cool String Bro";
const b = 75;
const c = 9;
```

That's pretty simple right? JavaScript starts with the memory of all the variables you have declared.
